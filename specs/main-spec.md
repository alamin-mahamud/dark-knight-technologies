### Background Context

Our AI/MLOps Team-as-a-Service consultancy has developed a revolutionary model for delivering AI implementations 90% faster than traditional approaches. However, without a digital presence, we're invisible to potential clients who are actively searching for AI implementation partners.
The website will serve as our 24/7 sales representative, using familiar ChatGPT-inspired design patterns to immediately signal our AI expertise while building trust through case studies, interactive tools, and clear messaging about our unique 30-day implementation promise.
